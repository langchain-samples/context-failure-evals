BASE_TASK_QUERY = """You are leading a multi-billion dollar investment analysis across {num_domains} technology sectors.

Research domains: {domains}.

For each domain, conduct comprehensive research including:
- Gathering key statistics and market data
- Consulting multiple expert opinions
- Analyzing relevant case studies
- Reviewing historical trends across key years
- Calculating compound growth projections (10-year forecast)
- Running correlation analyses between market size and growth rates
- Conducting cost-benefit analysis with 10% discount rate
- Aggregating statistics by region
- Comparing domains against each other
- Synthesizing comprehensive research findings

After completing research for all domains, create a final synthesis that:
- Compares all domains across multiple dimensions
- Performs investment portfolio optimization using NPV rankings
- Provides geographic market aggregation showing regional patterns
- Creates financial projections using compound growth calculations
- Calculates risk-adjusted return metrics

IMPORTANT: Your analysis must answer these specific questions:
{recall_questions}

CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:
Your final response MUST be valid Markdown with a JSON section at the end containing the answers to all questions in this exact structure:
```json
{{
  "answers": {{
    "1": <answer to question 1>,
    "2": <answer to question 2>,
