    "# Context Poisoning: When Errors Get Repeatedly Referenced\n",
    "\n",
    "Context poisoning occurs when a **hallucination or other error makes it into the context, where it is repeatedly referenced**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM agents often maintain context about their goals, progress, and state. When an error (hallucination, incorrect assumption, or wrong information) makes it into this context, the agent doesn't just use it once—it **keeps referencing it** over and over:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error enters context**: Agent hallucinates something (e.g., \"Research Quantum Dynamics Corp with ticker QDYN\")\n",
    "2. **Error gets stored**: The hallucination is saved in goals, summaries, or state\n",
    "3. **Repeated reference**: Agent repeatedly checks goals, sees the hallucinated item, and references it\n",
    "4. **Fixation**: Agent becomes stuck trying to achieve something impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context Poisoning Definition:** When a hallucination or other error makes it into the context, where it is repeatedly referenced, causing the agent to make decisions based on false information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the DeepMind Gemini 2.5 technical report: *\"An especially egregious form of this issue can take place with 'context poisoning'—where many parts of the context (goals, summary) are 'poisoned' with misinformation about the game state, which can often take a very long time to undo. As a result, the model can become fixated on achieving impossible or irrelevant goals.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **real production problem** affecting agents that:\n",
    "- Maintain multi-turn conversations\n",
    "- Track goals or tasks over time\n",
    "- Create summaries of their progress\n",
    "- Make decisions based on accumulated context\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Explore\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll demonstrate context poisoning with a financial research agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Inject** an error into the agent's context (a goal about researching a non-existent company)\n",
    "2. **Observe** how the agent repeatedly references this poisoned information\n",
    "3. **Measure** the impact: How many times does the agent reference the error? Does it recognize the problem?\n",
    "4. **Evaluate** recovery: Can the agent recognize impossible goals and stop pursuing them?\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal: Understand how errors poison context through repeated reference, and how to build agents that can detect and recover from poisoned context."

    "## Understanding Context Poisoning: The Repeated Reference Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Errors Get Repeatedly Referenced\n",
    "\n",
    "Context poisoning follows a specific pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Error**: The agent makes an error (hallucination, wrong assumption, incorrect state)\n",
    "   - Example: \"Research Quantum Dynamics Corp (ticker: QDYN)\"\n",
    "   - Reality: This company doesn't exist\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Storage**: The error gets stored in persistent context:\n",
    "   - Added to goals list via `add_research_goal()`\n",
    "   - Included in summaries via `create_research_summary()`\n",
    "   - Referenced in state via `get_current_research_state()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeated Reference Cycle**: Once stored, the error is referenced repeatedly:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Agent: Check current goals → Sees \"Research QDYN\"\n",
    "   Agent: Create summary → Includes \"Need to research QDYN\"\n",
    "   Agent: Plan next action → \"Let me research QDYN\"\n",
    "   Agent: Check goals again → Sees \"Research QDYN\"\n",
    "   Agent: Create another summary → Still includes \"Research QDYN\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fixation**: Each reference reinforces the error:\n",
    "   - Agent treats the error as fact because it's in the context\n",
    "   - Agent prioritizes the impossible goal\n",
    "   - Agent wastes steps trying to achieve something that cannot be done\n",
    "   - Agent struggles to \"undo\" the poisoned information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Repeated Reference Is Problematic\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reinforcement**: Each reference makes the error seem more legitimate\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Error stays in context across many turns\n",
    "- **Priority**: Poisoned goals often get high priority\n",
    "- **Wasted Effort**: Agent spends tokens and time on impossible tasks\n",
    "- **Difficult Recovery**: Hard to \"undo\" once firmly embedded in context\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measuring Repeated References\n",
    "\n",
    "We track:\n",
    "- **Reference count**: How many times the agent mentions the poisoned information\n",
    "- **Tool call attempts**: How many times the agent tries to act on the impossible goal\n",
    "- **Recovery detection**: Whether the agent eventually recognizes the error"

    "## Mitigation Strategies: Breaking the Repeated Reference Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Validate Before Storing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Errors enter context without verification  \n",
    "**Solution**: Validate information before adding it to goals/summaries\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Bad: Store without validation\n",
    "add_research_goal(\"Research QDYN\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Good: Validate first\n",
    "if verify_ticker_exists(\"QDYN\"):\n",
    "    add_research_goal(\"Research QDYN\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    log_error(\"Ticker QDYN doesn't exist\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Detect Repeated Failures\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Agent keeps referencing and attempting impossible goals  \n",
    "**Solution**: Track failures and cancel goals after repeated attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# If agent tries same goal 3+ times without success\n",
    "if goal_attempt_count > 3 and not goal_completed:\n",
    "    cancel_goal(goal_id, reason=\"Cannot be completed after multiple attempts\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Ground Truth Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Summaries include unverified claims  \n",
    "**Solution**: Cross-check summaries against actual state\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Before including in summary\n",
    "summary_items = filter(lambda item: verify_against_state(item), proposed_items)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Goal Review and Cancellation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Impossible goals persist indefinitely  \n",
    "**Solution**: Enable agents to recognize and cancel impossible goals\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Agent should be able to do this\n",
    "if goal_cannot_be_achieved(goal):\n",
    "    update_goal_status(goal_id, \"cancelled\")\n",
    "    log_reason(\"Ticker does not exist in available data sources\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Context Refresh\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Old poisoned information lingers  \n",
    "**Solution**: Periodically validate and refresh context\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Every N turns, validate stored goals\n",
    "for goal in active_goals:\n",
    "    if not validate_goal(goal):\n",
    "        remove_from_context(goal)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Explicit Error Signals\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**: Tools return errors but agent doesn't update context  \n",
    "**Solution**: Make tool errors more explicit and actionable\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tool should return clear signals\n",
    "result = get_stock_price(\"QDYN\")\n",
    "if result.error == \"TICKER_NOT_FOUND\":\n",
    "    # Agent should update its context immediately\n",
    "    remove_goal_about_ticker(\"QDYN\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "**Break the cycle of repeated reference** by:\n",
    "- Validating before storing\n",
    "- Detecting repeated failures  \n",
    "- Enabling goal cancellation\n",
    "- Refreshing context regularly\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Problem: Repeated Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "Context poisoning is fundamentally about **repeated reference**:\n",
    "- An error enters context once (hallucination, wrong assumption, incorrect state)\n",
    "- But it gets **used many times** (every goal check, every summary, every planning step)\n",
    "- Each reference reinforces the error and wastes compute\n",
    "- Recovery requires explicitly removing or correcting the poisoned information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It's Hard\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Errors stored in goals/summaries persist across many turns\n",
    "- **Reinforcement**: Each reference makes the error seem more legitimate\n",
    "- **Prioritization**: Agents often prioritize poisoned goals\n",
    "- **Lack of Validation**: Agents don't naturally verify if goals are achievable\n",
    "- **Context Accumulation**: More turns = more references = harder to recover\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Measured\n",
    "\n",
    "Using LangSmith evaluations, we tracked:\n",
    "- **Reference count**: How many times the agent mentions poisoned information\n",
    "- **Impossible goal pursuit**: Whether the agent tries to achieve unachievable goals\n",
    "- **Goal cancellation**: Whether the agent recognizes and cancels impossible goals\n",
    "- **Task completion**: Whether the agent completes real tasks despite poisoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building Resilient Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent repeated reference of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validate before storing** - Check information before adding to goals/summaries\n",
    "2. **Detect repeated failures** - Cancel goals that fail multiple times\n",
    "3. **Cross-check summaries** - Verify summary contents against ground truth\n",
    "4. **Enable cancellation** - Let agents recognize and cancel impossible goals\n",
    "5. **Refresh context** - Periodically validate and clean stored information\n",
    "6. **Make errors explicit** - Ensure tool errors clearly signal problems\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Context poisoning isn't just about making one error—it's about **repeatedly using that error** over many turns. The key to mitigation is breaking the cycle of repeated reference by validating, detecting, and removing poisoned information before it dominates agent behavior."
