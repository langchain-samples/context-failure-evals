    "# Context Poisoning: When Errors Get Repeatedly Referenced\n",
    "\n",
    "Context poisoning occurs when a **hallucination or other error makes it into the context, where it is repeatedly referenced**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a simple pattern to demonstrate context poisoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Baseline Success**: Agent completes a research task successfully\n",
    "2. ⏪ **Rewind & Inject**: Return to a checkpoint and inject poisoned information into context\n",
    "3. ❌ **Agent Struggles**: Same agent now fails or wastes effort due to poisoned context\n",
    "4. 🛡️ **Improved Agent**: Better prompt/architecture that's resilient to poisoning\n",
    "5. ✅ **Resilient Success**: Improved agent handles poisoned context correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM agents often maintain context about their goals, progress, and state. When an error makes it into this context, the agent doesn't just use it once—it **keeps referencing it** over and over:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error enters context**: Agent hallucinates something (e.g., \"Research Quantum Dynamics Corp with ticker QDYN\")\n",
    "2. **Error gets stored**: The hallucination is saved in goals, summaries, or state\n",
    "3. **Repeated reference**: Agent repeatedly checks goals, sees the hallucinated item, and references it\n",
    "4. **Fixation**: Agent becomes stuck trying to achieve something impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the DeepMind Gemini 2.5 technical report: *\"An especially egregious form of this issue can take place with 'context poisoning'—where many parts of the context (goals, summary) are 'poisoned' with misinformation... As a result, the model can become fixated on achieving impossible or irrelevant goals.\"*"

    "   - Before working on a research goal, verify the ticker/company exists\n",
    "   - If get_stock_price or get_company_info returns an error, the ticker doesn't exist\n",
    "   - Immediately cancel goals about non-existent tickers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recognize Tool Errors Quickly**:\n",
    "   - If a tool returns \"not found\", \"doesn't exist\", or similar errors, treat it as definitive\n",
    "   - Do NOT retry the same ticker multiple times\n",
    "   - Update the goal status to \"cancelled\" with a clear reason\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid Repeated References**:\n",
    "   - Once you determine something doesn't exist, don't mention it again\n",
    "   - Don't include impossible goals in summaries\n",
    "   - Focus on achievable goals\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Error Handling Pattern**:\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "## Understanding the Problem: Repeated Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happened\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Enters Context**: Agent's goal includes researching \"QDYN\" (doesn't exist)\n",
    "2. **Gets Stored**: Goal is saved in the agent's goal tracking system\n",
    "3. **Repeated Reference**: Agent checks goals → sees QDYN → references it → checks again → sees QDYN → references it...\n",
    "4. **Wasted Compute**: Each reference wastes tokens and API calls on impossible tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It's Problematic\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Not a one-time error**: The hallucination gets used multiple times\n",
    "- **Reinforcement**: Each reference makes the error seem more legitimate\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Error stays in context across many turns\n",
    "- **Difficult to escape**: Agent needs explicit validation to stop the cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The improved agent breaks the cycle by:\n",
    "1. **Validating early**: Check if ticker exists before pursuing\n",
    "2. **Recognizing errors**: Treat tool errors as definitive signals\n",
    "3. **Canceling quickly**: Update goal status to \"cancelled\" immediately\n",
    "4. **Avoiding repetition**: Don't reference cancelled goals again"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context poisoning = Repeated reference to errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "An error (hallucination, wrong data, bad assumption) enters context once, but gets **used many times**:\n",
    "- Every goal check references it\n",
    "- Every summary includes it\n",
    "- Every planning step considers it\n",
    "- Each reference wastes compute and reinforces the error\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Baseline**: Agent completes task successfully without errors\n",
    "2. ⏪ **Rewind + Inject**: Same starting point, but with poisoned goal\n",
    "3. ❌ **Poisoned Run**: Agent references error multiple times\n",
    "4. 🛡️ **Improved Agent**: Better validation and error handling\n",
    "5. ✅ **Resilient Run**: Improved agent minimizes repeated references\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building Resilient Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent repeated reference of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validate Before Storing**: Check information before adding to goals/context\n",
    "2. **Recognize Tool Errors**: Treat \"not found\" errors as definitive\n",
    "3. **Cancel Quickly**: Update impossible goals to \"cancelled\" immediately\n",
    "4. **Avoid Re-reference**: Don't mention cancelled goals again\n",
    "5. **Make Errors Explicit**: Clear error signals help agents recover faster\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Context poisoning isn't about making one error—it's about **repeatedly using that error**. The key to mitigation is breaking the cycle of repeated reference through validation, quick error recognition, and explicit goal cancellation."

    "The problem isn't just making an error—it's repeatedly using that error across multiple turns, wasting compute and reinforcing incorrect information.\n",

    "### Mitigation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Break the cycle of repeated reference by:\n",
    "- Validating information before storing in context\n",
    "- Recognizing tool errors as definitive signals\n",
    "- Canceling impossible goals quickly\n",
    "- Avoiding re-reference of known errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To build more resilient agents:\n",
    "1. Add validation at context entry points (goals, summaries)\n",
    "2. Make tool error signals more explicit\n",
    "3. Track repeated failures and auto-cancel\n",
    "4. Test with LangSmith evaluations to measure improvement\n",
    "5. Monitor reference counts in production to detect poisoning"
