    "# Context Poisoning: When Errors Get Repeatedly Referenced\n",
    "\n",
    "Context poisoning occurs when a **hallucination or other error makes it into the context, where it is repeatedly referenced**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook follows a simple pattern to demonstrate context poisoning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Baseline Success**: Agent completes a research task successfully\n",
    "2. ⏪ **Rewind & Inject**: Return to a checkpoint and inject poisoned information into context\n",
    "3. ❌ **Agent Struggles**: Same agent now fails or wastes effort due to poisoned context\n",
    "4. 🛡️ **Improved Agent**: Better prompt/architecture that's resilient to poisoning\n",
    "5. ✅ **Resilient Success**: Improved agent handles poisoned context correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM agents often maintain context about their goals, progress, and state. When an error makes it into this context, the agent doesn't just use it once—it **keeps referencing it** over and over:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error enters context**: Agent hallucinates something (e.g., \"Research Quantum Dynamics Corp with ticker QDYN\")\n",
    "2. **Error gets stored**: The hallucination is saved in goals, summaries, or state\n",
    "3. **Repeated reference**: Agent repeatedly checks goals, sees the hallucinated item, and references it\n",
    "4. **Fixation**: Agent becomes stuck trying to achieve something impossible\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted in the DeepMind Gemini 2.5 technical report: *\"An especially egregious form of this issue can take place with 'context poisoning'—where many parts of the context (goals, summary) are 'poisoned' with misinformation... As a result, the model can become fixated on achieving impossible or irrelevant goals.\"*"

    "## Understanding the Problem: Repeated Reference\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happened\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Enters Context**: Agent's goal includes researching \"QDYN\" (doesn't exist)\n",
    "2. **Gets Stored**: Goal is saved in the agent's goal tracking system\n",
    "3. **Repeated Reference**: Agent checks goals → sees QDYN → references it → checks again → sees QDYN → references it...\n",
    "4. **Wasted Compute**: Each reference wastes tokens and API calls on impossible tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It's Problematic\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Not a one-time error**: The hallucination gets used multiple times\n",
    "- **Reinforcement**: Each reference makes the error seem more legitimate\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Error stays in context across many turns\n",
    "- **Difficult to escape**: Agent needs explicit validation to stop the cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "The improved agent breaks the cycle by:\n",
    "1. **Validating early**: Check if ticker exists before pursuing\n",
    "2. **Recognizing errors**: Treat tool errors as definitive signals\n",
    "3. **Canceling quickly**: Update goal status to \"cancelled\" immediately\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Core Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context poisoning = Repeated reference to errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "An error (hallucination, wrong data, bad assumption) enters context once, but gets **used many times**:\n",
    "- Every goal check references it\n",
    "- Every summary includes it\n",
    "- Every planning step considers it\n",
    "- Each reference wastes compute and reinforces the error\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ **Baseline**: Agent completes task successfully without errors\n",
    "2. ⏪ **Rewind + Inject**: Same starting point, but with poisoned goal\n",
    "3. ❌ **Poisoned Run**: Agent references error multiple times\n",
    "4. 🛡️ **Improved Agent**: Better validation and error handling\n",
    "5. ✅ **Resilient Run**: Improved agent minimizes repeated references\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building Resilient Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent repeated reference of errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Validate Before Storing**: Check information before adding to goals/context\n",
    "2. **Recognize Tool Errors**: Treat \"not found\" errors as definitive\n",
    "3. **Cancel Quickly**: Update impossible goals to \"cancelled\" immediately\n",
    "4. **Avoid Re-reference**: Don't mention cancelled goals again\n",
    "5. **Make Errors Explicit**: Clear error signals help agents recover faster\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bottom Line\n",
    "\n",
    "Context poisoning isn't about making one error—it's about **repeatedly using that error**. The key to mitigation is breaking the cycle of repeated reference through validation, quick error recognition, and explicit goal cancellation."

    "\n",
    "**Context poisoning = One error, many references**\n",

    "1. Add validation at context entry points (goals, summaries)\n",
    "2. Make tool error signals more explicit\n",
    "3. Track repeated failures and auto-cancel\n",
    "4. Test with LangSmith evaluations to measure improvement\n",
